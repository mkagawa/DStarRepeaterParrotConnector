# D-Star Repeater Parrot Connector

This is a fork from D-Star Repeater Connector project. 

The connector is works as d-star echo server, when it is working together both DStarRepeater and ircDDBGateway.
This project simulates DVAP (red dongle) adaptor. Once it receives D-star digital stream, store it in memory, and echo back after original stream has finished.
